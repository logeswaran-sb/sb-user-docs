## Introduction

You can access documentation related to user operations and functionalities for the StackBill application by visiting the official documentation portal at [**https://docs.stackbill.com/**](https://docs.stackbill.com/). This portal contains detailed guides and references tailored for end users to help them navigate and utilize the platform effectively.

If you require access to administrative documentation, which provides advanced features and settings for managing StackBill, you can request it after completing your license activation. The administrative documentation typically includes details about configuration, and advanced usage for system administrators.

To obtain access to the admin documentation, you can reach out to the **StackBill support team** via email at **support@stackbill.com**. Once your request is verified, they will provide the necessary URL to access the admin resources. This ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive administrative materials.
