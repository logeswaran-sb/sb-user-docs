### Types of Deployment Models Offered by Stackbill

Stackbill provides two flexible deployment models to cater to the diverse needs of its customers: Self Deployment and Product Team Deployment. These options allow customers to choose the deployment method that best suits their technical expertise and resource availability.

### Self Deployment

This model empowers customers to take full control of the Stackbill installation process in their own environment. Customers who opt for self-deployment can independently prepare and install their Stackbill setup without requiring assistance from the Stackbill team. Here’s how it works:

#### 1. Comprehensive Documentation:

Customers are provided with a detailed installation guide containing step-by-step instructions to deploy the Stackbill application seamlessly. The documentation is designed to be user-friendly, enabling even first-time users to follow along with confidence.

#### 2. Empowerment and Ownership:

By handling the deployment themselves, customers gain valuable hands-on experience with the Stackbill platform, equipping them with the skills to manage and troubleshoot the system effectively in the future.

#### 3. Cost-Effective Solution:

Since no external involvement is required, this option minimizes deployment costs, making it an ideal choice for organizations with sufficient technical expertise in cloud platforms and Kubernetes.

This model is particularly suitable for customers conducting proof-of-concept (POC) installations or those with internal IT teams experienced in managing cloud-native applications.


### Product Team Deployment

For customers who prefer to entrust the deployment process to experts, Stackbill offers Product Team Deployment as a comprehensive, end-to-end service. With this option:

#### 1. Expert-Led Deployment:

The highly skilled Stackbill product team, with over 20+ years of collective industry experience in cloud platforms, handles the entire deployment process. From setting up Kubernetes clusters to integrating database systems and configuring applications, every aspect of the deployment is managed by seasoned professionals.

#### 2. Hassle-Free Setup:

Customers can offload the complexity of deployment to the Stackbill team, enabling them to focus on other critical business tasks. This ensures a faster, smoother, and error-free setup process.

#### 3. Tailored for Large-Scale Environments:

This model is particularly suited for production-grade deployments with large-scale environments supporting 50K+ users or those requiring advanced customization's.

#### 4. Additional Costs:

While this model provides unmatched convenience and peace of mind, it is important to note that Stackbill charges an additional fee for this service, which is separate from the license cost.
