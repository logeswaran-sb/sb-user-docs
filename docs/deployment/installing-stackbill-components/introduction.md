## Installation Stackbill Components

The installation of Stackbill involves setting up various essential components required to build a robust, scalable, and efficient cloud management platform. Below is an overview of the key components and their roles in the system:

#### 1. Kubernetes

Kubernetes serves as the backbone of the Stackbill platform, orchestrating containerized services. It manages application deployments, scaling, and maintenance, ensuring high availability and resource efficiency. Install Kubernetes to establish the foundational cluster for Stackbill.

#### 2. NFS Server

The Network File System (NFS) server is used for shared storage across the Kubernetes cluster. It facilitates persistent storage for applications and services by providing a centralized, scalable storage solution. Install and configure the NFS server to enable seamless file sharing across cluster nodes.

#### 3. MySQL

MySQL serves as the relational database for storing structured data required by Stackbill, including user information, resource configurations, and billing data. Set up a MySQL server with high availability and secure access for optimal performance.

#### 4. MongoDB

MongoDB acts as the NoSQL database for managing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as logs, events, and metadata. Install and configure MongoDB to support dynamic, scalable data handling.

#### 4. HELM

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of Kubernetes applications. Use Helm to install and manage Stackbill's microservices and dependencies efficiently, leveraging Helm charts for repeatable and reliable deployments.

#### 5. ISTIO

Istio is a service mesh that enhances traffic management, security, and observability for microservices. Integrate Istio with the Kubernetes cluster to enable advanced networking features, such as load balancing, traffic routing, and service-to-service authentication.

#### 6. HAProxy Cluster

HAProxy is a reliable load balancer and reverse proxy that ensures the distribution of traffic across Stackbill's services. Configure an HAProxy cluster for high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring continuous service availability even during peak loads or node failures.
