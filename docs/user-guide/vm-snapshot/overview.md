The **VM Snapshot** feature in the Cloud Management Portal enables users to create and manage **snapshots of their virtual machines**. A snapshot captures the complete state of a VM at a given point in time—including the OS, disk state, and memory (if applicable)—allowing users to easily restore their system in case of unexpected changes or failures.

This is an essential backup utility to enhance VM data protection and enable faster recovery.

#### 1. Accessing the VM Snapshot Page :

Navigate to: `Compute` > `VM Snapshots`

The VM Snapshot dashboard will display:

-   A list of existing VM snapshots (if available)
    
-   A button to **Add VM Snapshot**
    
-   Status indicators and action controls for each snapshot (when present)

#### 2. VM Snapshot Elements :

- When no snapshots are present, the interface will display:

> **"Looks like you don't have any snapshots for your instances."**

- Clicking the **Add VM Snapshot** button will allow you to create a snapshot for a selected instance.

#### 4. Search and Refresh :

-   **Quick Search**: Use the search bar at the top to filter snapshots by name or instance.
    
-   **Refresh**: Click the refresh icon to reload and view the latest snapshot data.
