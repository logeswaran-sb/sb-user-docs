Kubernetes, also known as _K8s_, is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The Cloud Management Portal provides a powerful and user-friendly interface to manage Kubernetes clusters, allowing users to deploy, monitor, and maintain containerized workloads efficiently.

### **What is Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes is designed to simplify the complexities of managing large-scale containerized environments. It abstracts the underlying infrastructure and provides a consistent platform to run applications across different environments—whether on-premise or in the cloud.

Key benefits include:

-   **Automated Deployment**  
    Automatically roll out application updates and roll back changes with zero downtime.
    
-   **Self-Healing**  
    Kubernetes monitors the health of containers and restarts or replaces them when failures occur.
    
-   **Horizontal Scaling**  
    Scale applications up or down based on demand using simple commands or auto-scaling policies.
    
-   **Service Discovery & Load Balancing**  
    Automatically exposes containers using DNS and balances network traffic across them.
    
-   **Secret & Configuration Management**  
    Manage sensitive data and application configuration without rebuilding your container images.

### **Kubernetes in the Cloud Management Portal**

The Cloud Management Portal offers full lifecycle support for Kubernetes clusters, simplifying cluster operations for both development and production environments.

#### **Key Features**

-   **Cluster Creation**  
    Create and configure Kubernetes clusters using predefined templates or advanced setup options.
    
-   **Node Management**  
    Add or remove worker nodes to meet scaling requirements. Monitor node health and resource usage.
    
-   **Namespace & Resource Control**  
    Organize workloads using Kubernetes namespaces and apply resource quotas for better governance.
    
-   **Dashboard Integration**  
    Access Kubernetes Dashboard and CLI tools directly from the portal for in-depth control and visibility.
    
-   **Storage & Volume Support**  
    Attach persistent volumes and manage dynamic storage provisioning for stateful workloads.
