The **Advanced Monitoring** feature in the Cloud Management Portal provides real-time insights into the performance and health of virtual machines (VMs). It allows users to monitor various system metrics, receive alerts, and analyze historical data to optimize resource usage and troubleshoot potential issues proactively.

### Available Features in Advanced Monitoring

### 1. Real-Time Monitoring

-   Tracks the performance and status of cloud resources.
    
-   Displays CPU usage, memory consumption, disk activity, and network performance in real-time.
    
-   Supports interactive graphs and visualization tools.

### 2. VM Status & Uptime

-   Indicates whether the VM is **Running, Stopped, or Down**.
    
-   Displays **Uptime Information** 
    
-   Helps users track system availability and detect unexpected shutdowns.

### 3. CPU Monitoring

-   **CPU Usage:** Displays the percentage of CPU utilization.
    
-   **CPU Load:** Monitors the workload on the VM’s processor.
    
-   **Processors Information:** Details about the number of processors allocated to the VM.

### 4. Memory Usage

-   Provides real-time insights into memory utilization.
    
-   Identifies memory-intensive applications impacting system performance.
    
-   Allows users to optimize VM resource allocation.

### 5. Network Activity

-   Tracks network traffic and bandwidth consumption.
    
-   Monitors incoming and outgoing data transfers.
    
-   Helps troubleshoot connectivity issues.

### 6. Disk Performance

-   Displays disk read/write speed and I/O operations.
    
-   Monitors disk space usage.
    
-   Detects potential bottlenecks affecting performance.

### 7. Alert Configuration & Notifications

-   Users can set **custom alerts** for CPU, memory, disk, and network thresholds.
    
-   Notifications can be sent via email or integrated with other monitoring tools.
    
-   Helps prevent unexpected downtime by providing early warnings on critical events.

### 8. Service Monitoring

-   Tracks running services and system processes.
    
-   Helps ensure that essential applications and background processes are functioning correctly.

### 9. Historical Data Analysis

-   Allows users to view VM performance trends over **1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, or 24 hours**.
    
-   Enables comparison of system performance over different time periods.
    
-   Supports better decision-making for resource scaling.

### 10. Maintenance Mode

-   A toggle switch enables or disables **Maintenance Mode**.
    
-   Prevents unnecessary alerts when performing maintenance tasks.
    
-   Ensures that scheduled downtime is not flagged as an issue.

### 11. User Settings & Customization

-   **Dark Mode:** Toggle available for better readability.
    
-   **Pinned Widgets:** Users can customize their monitoring dashboard by pinning essential metrics.
    
-   **Notification Groups:** Configure groups to receive system alerts efficiently.
