The **Notes** feature in the virtual machine (VM) management interface enables users to add, manage, and reference important information related to a specific VM instance. This functionality is particularly useful for operational tracking, team collaboration, and auditing purposes.

### **Purpose of Notes**

The Notes section is designed to provide a centralized area for storing user-defined annotations that are specific to the selected VM. It can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

-   Tracking changes or updates made to the VM.
    
-   Logging maintenance tasks or configuration changes.
    
-   Communicating handover details between team members.
    
-   Recording troubleshooting actions or issues encountered.

### **Interface Overview**

The Notes section comprises two main components:

#### **1. Notes List Panel**

-   Displays all previously added notes associated with the VM.
    
-   Notes are listed chronologically with the most recent entries shown first.
    
-   If no notes have been added, the panel will display the message:  
    **"No records found!"**

#### **2. Add Notes Panel**

-   Allows users to input new notes.
    
-   The **Note** field is mandatory and accepts free-text input.
    
-   A tool-tip icon provides additional guidance on what to enter.
    
-   After writing the note, click the **"Add"** button to save it.

Once saved, the note appears in the Notes List Panel and is associated permanently with the VM instance until manually removed.
