The Cloud Management Portal offers flexible options for Windows licensing to suit different business and compliance needs. This section outlines the available methods to license Windows Virtual Machines (VMs) created within the portal.

#### 1. Automatic Licensing Activated Templates

With this option, VMs are deployed using pre-activated Windows templates. These templates come with built-in licensing, and the activation process is handled automatically during VM provisioning.

**Key Benefits:**

-   No manual activation required.
    
-   Ensures compliance with Windows licensing terms.
    
-   Recommended for users who prefer a ready-to-use Windows environment.

Ideal for customers who want to quickly deploy production-ready Windows VMs without managing license keys manually.

#### 2. BYOL (Bring Your Own License)

The BYOL method allows users to use their own licensed Windows images or activate their instances post-deployment using personal or enterprise volume license keys.

**Key Benefits:**

-   Greater control over licensing.
    
-   Suitable for organizations with enterprise agreements or volume licensing contracts.
    
-   Flexibility to meet internal compliance policies.
    
This model will be useful for users who already own valid Windows licenses and prefer to manage activation independently.

If you're unsure which licensing method suits your business, please contact your account manager or raise a support ticket via the portal. Our support team will guide you based on your usage model and compliance requirements.
