The **Instance Landing Page** in the Cloud Management Portal provides users with an interface to manage their virtual machines (VMs). From this page, users can create, monitor, and manage instances that serve as cloud-based virtual servers for their applications and workloads.

Users can access this page by navigating to **Compute → Instance** in the left-side menu.

### Key Features of the Instance Landing Page

#### 1. Instance Overview Panel :

At the top of the page, users can view a summary of their current VM instances, including:

-   **Total Instances**: The total number of virtual machines created.
    
-   **Running Instances**: The number of active VMs currently in operation.
    
-   **Stopped Instances**: VMs that have been created but are currently powered off.

This section provides an immediate status check of all instances under the user's account.

#### 2. Instance Search and Filter Options :

The **Instance Landing Page** includes a powerful search and filtering mechanism to help users quickly find specific instances:

**Search Option :**

-   A **Quick Search** bar is available at the top right corner, allowing users to enter instance names or keywords to locate specific virtual machines instantly.

**Filter Options :**

-   Users can filter instances based on their **billing model**, choosing from:
    
    -   **Pay-Per-Use Instances** – Instances billed based on hourly or metered usage.
        
    -   **Reserved Instances** – Pre-purchased instances with a fixed billing period.
        
    -   **Bundle Instances** – Pre-configured VM packages with predefined resources.

These filters provide better visibility into different instance types and help users manage their cloud resources effectively.


#### 3. Instance Management Section :

If no instances have been created, users will see a message stating:  

_"Looks like you don’t have any VMs created."_

Users can then click the **"Add Instance"** button to create a new VM. This button allows users to launch a virtual machine with a preferred operating system, allocated CPU, memory, and storage configurations.
