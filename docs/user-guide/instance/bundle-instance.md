### Overview

A **Bundle Instance** is a pre-configured collection of cloud resources packaged together to enable quick and simplified virtual machine (VM) deployment. Each bundle includes predefined specifications such as:

-   **CPU**
    
-   **RAM**
    
-   **Storage**
    
-   **Public IP Address**
    
-   **Bandwidth**
    
This setup allows users to deploy a fully configured virtual machine in just a few clicks, minimizing manual configuration and speeding up the provisioning process.

### Cancellation Policy

- If a bundle offer is **manually cancelled**, the resources (VM and services) will remain active until the **end of the current billing cycle** (typically the end of the month). After this point, the associated VM will be automatically deleted.

- If the **bundle VM is deleted manually** before the end of the term, the **associated bundle offer is also terminated immediately**.

### Resize Limitations

- **VM resizing is not supported** for instances created through a bundle offer.

- Users must select the correct configuration at the time of bundle selection, as modifications to CPU, RAM, or storage are **not permitted** post-deployment.

### Pricing and Billing

- Charges begin from the **date of bundle purchase** and are calculated **pro-rata** until the end of the current plan period.

- Upon auto-renewal, the full amount for the new billing period (typically a calendar month) will be charged.

- Pricing and resource quotas for each bundle offer are pre-defined and non-customizable.
