### Overview

The Cloud Management Portal provides two deployment methods for launching virtual machines (VMs): **Quick Deploy** and **Advanced Deploy**. Each method caters to different user needs, balancing ease of use with advanced customization options.

### Quick Deploy

The **Quick Deploy** option is designed for users who need to create a VM quickly with minimal configuration. It streamlines the deployment process, making it ideal for standard use cases where advanced network and storage configurations are not required.

**Key Features of Quick Deploy:**

-   Simple and fast VM creation process.
    
-   Automatically assigns the default network settings.
    
-   No option to create a new network during deployment.
    
-   No ability to add additional block storage.

### **Advanced Deploy**

The **Advanced Deploy** option is tailored for users who require greater control over VM configuration. It provides extensive options for network setup, storage allocation, and other advanced settings.

**Key Features of Advanced Deploy:**

-   Allows manual network configuration, including the option to create a new network.
    
-   Provides the ability to attach additional block storage during VM creation.
    
-   Suitable for complex infrastructure setups requiring public IP allocation and custom network settings.

**Comparison: Quick Deploy vs. Advanced Deploy**

| Feature | Quick Deploy | Advance Deploy
|------|------|------
|Deployment Speed| Fast and streamlined | Requires additional configuration
|Network Configuration|Uses default network settings|Allows manual network setup
|Additional Block Storage|Not available|Can be added during deployment
|Recommended For|Basic users, rapid deployment|Advanced users, custom setups

### Choosing the Right Deployment Method

-   Use **Quick Deploy** if you need a VM up and running in just a few steps without complex configurations.
    
-   Use **Advanced Deploy** if you require a customized networking setup or additional storage options during deployment.
    
By selecting the appropriate deployment method, users can optimize their cloud environment based on their operational requirements.
