The **KYC (Know Your Customer) Verification** process in the Cloud Management Portal ensures secure and compliant user onboarding by collecting valid identity documentation. This process helps verify the authenticity of user accounts and ensures adherence to regulatory and organizational compliance standards.

This section provides a step-by-step walkthrough of how to upload your KYC documents, track the verification status, and respond to feedback—all within the portal.

### KYC Process Overview

The KYC process is broken into three key stages, each represented with a visual indicator in the portal:

- **Document Upload** – Initial stage where users upload their required documents.
    
- **Verification In-Process** – Your documents are being reviewed by the admin team.
    
- **Verification Completed** – Your documents are approved and KYC is marked as complete.
    
Each stage includes visual progress markers that automatically update as you move through the verification steps.

### Step 1: Uploading Your Documents

Based on the portal's configuration (set by the administrator), users must upload specific documents.

> In the demo environment, **Aadhaar Card** is the required document.

#### Upload Instructions:

-   Under the **"Upload Your Documents"** section, click the **Browse** button.

-   Once selected, click the **Submit** button to send your document for verification.

### Step 2: Document Review & Status

After submission, the KYC request enters the **Verification In-Process** stage:

-   The **portal admin** will review your submitted document.

-   Based on validation, they can either:
    
    -   **Approve** the document — moving your KYC to a **completed** state.
        
    -   **Reject** the document — requiring you to upload a corrected document.

---

### Admin Comments

- If your submission is rejected or requires additional information, the admin may leave a message under the **"Admin Comments"** section.

- This section helps you understand the reason for rejection and guides your next steps (e.g., re-uploading a clearer copy or correcting mismatched details).

### Re-submission Process

If your document is rejected:

- Return to the **KYC Verification** page.
    
- Upload a new document that meets the specified requirements.
    
- Click **Submit** again to restart the verification process.  

This process continues until the admin successfully verifies your submission and the KYC status is marked as complete.
