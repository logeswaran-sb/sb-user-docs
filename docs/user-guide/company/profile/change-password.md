To maintain account security and ensure only authorized access, users are encouraged to change their passwords periodically. The **Change Password** feature in the Cloud Management Portal provides a straightforward, secure way for users to update their login credentials without administrative intervention.

### Accessing the Change Password Section

-   Log in to your Cloud Management Portal.
    
-   In the left-hand navigation panel, go to **Company > Profile**.

### Change Password Interface

- The interface consists of three primary input fields, all of which are mandatory:

|Field Label|Description
|---|---|
|**Old Password**|Enter your current password. This ensures only the authenticated user can update the password.
|**New Password**|Enter the new password you wish to use. Ensure it follows the password policy.
|**Confirm Password**|Re-enter the new password for confirmation. This step helps eliminate typing errors.

- Each password field includes a **visibility toggle icon** (eye symbol) allowing you to show/hide the password as you type.

### Password Policy Guidelines

To strengthen account security, the new password must typically adhere to the following requirements (may vary based on portal settings):

-   Minimum of **8 characters**
    
-   At least one **uppercase letter (A–Z)**
    
-   At least one **lowercase letter (a–z)**
    
-   At least one **number (0–9)**
    
-   At least one **special character** (e.g., `@`, `#`, `$`, etc.)
    

> **Note**: Passwords must not match previous passwords and must differ significantly from common dictionary terms.

> **Important**: Please note that if a user changes their password in one session, any other active sessions under the same user account will not be affected. To reflect the updated password, the user must log out of the other sessions and log in again using the new password.
