### Subscription Status Dashboard

#### 1. Status :

- Upon navigating to the **Subscription** section, you will see a status card summarizing the key subscription details.

- The status indicates that your subscription is currently **not active** in this demo environment. Services linked to a paid plan may be suspended until the subscription is reactivated or renewed.
